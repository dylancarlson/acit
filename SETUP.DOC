MAIN SYSTEM:
 
        Read this once through before you try it.
        
        First thing to do is make a directory that you want the BBS files to 
be in on your HardDrive. If you dont have a hard drive, go get one. (this 
thing takes up a lot of space, and the overlays run slow off floppys, it is
not recomended). 
        Often the directory is called \CIT. This directoy is known as the 
"HOMEPATH". This name is used in the config.cit file, so you should remeber 
it. 
        Then unzip all the files into that directory. Leave the HELP.ZIP
file ziped for a second. Under that directoy you need to make a "HELPPATH"
directory. Commonly \CIT\HELP. Unzip help.zip to this directory. 
        
        Now you need to make the other paths that citadel will look for. 
These are "TEMPPATH", "APPLICATION", "MSGPATH", "TEMPPATH", and "ROOMPATH".
Suggested ones are:
 
\CIT            HOMEPATH and MSGPATH
\CIT\HELP       HELPPATH
\CIT\ROOMS      ROOMPATH
\CIT\TEMP       TEMPPATH
\CIT\APLIC      APPLICATION

        NOTE: no path may be a root directory. If you want to use a ram disk, 
for your temppath (highly recomended if you are going to network) you need to
make a directory on that disk to use.

        Edit the CONFIG.CIT file with a TEXT EDITOR. It must be saved as a
dos text file, not some funny format like Nerd Perfect likes to use. This 
file contains the confguration of your system, like its name. Read it and
change it to suit you. 

        Run the CTDL.EXE program. It will create the room file, message base,
and all that. Then create yourself an account. The sysop function are accessed
through the F6 key. 


        GOOD LUCK!
