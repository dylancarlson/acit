 ------ 3.11.00 --------04/17/90--------------------------------------------
        * Bug fixes
          Many reported bugs have been fixed in this release, to many to 
          list here even if I remebered them all.
        
        * #TWIT_FEATURES
          Just something from the features department to keep things from
          getting too boring. See the new CONFIG.CIT. Has Titles as well
          as surnames, borders, and message nyms.
 
        * Modem code
          The serial IO package that DragCit has been using had a lot
          of problems, this was causing interupts to be trashed in 
          the previous versions. This has been fixed.
 
        * Turbo C
          DragCit is now compiled with Turbo C.
 
        * Source Code
          With the 3.11.00 Beta release source code will be made avalible.
 
        * Applications
          The application interface has been reworked. In the place of
          userdat?.apl files there is now an output.apl. This file's 
          format is flexible, allowing changed to it w/o messing up 
          existing applications. However, application designed for use
          with 3.10.05 and below will not work with this version. 
          Also if your aplication is a batch file you must use a $ as
          the first character to tell DragCit to load COMMAND.COM. 
          Failing to do this will cause your system to crash when it 
          tries to run the .BAT file as an EXE file. This saves memory
          and time when running EXEs and COMs.
 
        * ANSI 
          Used a little more here and there..
 
        * Infolines
          Infolines now show when you goto a room w/o a room description.
 
 ------ 3.10.05 --------06/16/89--------------------------------------------
        * Internal cleanup 
          Much closer to finishing the fist level of cleanup. This is
          very good, it should reduce the number of random errors a lot
          and make the software more reliable.
 
        * 24K more in a shell!
          Or there abouts, I only started keeping track a little after
          3.10.04 so that # may be a little off (+/- 2K).  More overlays
          as you may have guessed. (related to message and log code.)
 
        * Confugure, and Userlog Edit menus
          These menus are rather a new idea in the interface, see what you
          think of them, and any suggested changes to it.
 
        * Chat
          You can now pull people into chat from any place that gets a 
          string, or that is a get Yes No prompt. This is sort of a nice
          trick if you want to chat someone before they are logged in.
 
          If the remote has ansi on, then chat colors are transmited to
          them as well. 
 
          Word wrap, no more hitting returns!
 
        * .Known # of Messages Rooms
          New known rooms display type:
          room>                 234 messages,  23 new, (mail)
          Play with it. Also can be combined with Verbose. 
 
 ------ 3.10.04 --------06/06/89--------------------------------------------
        * Internal cleanup 
          We have been spending a lot of time cleaning up the internals
          of DragCit. Still a lot to do, but it is hoped that this version
          will prove to have less of those unexplanable crashes. 
 
        * Interupt traping
          Tradewars and other applications which mangle interups will run
          with this version. TW was nuking the overlay managers interupt,
          with perdictable results.
 
        * Pause on Full screen
          Pause every x lines, mostly for console and 9600 users, others 
          might also find it useful. (it was mainly installed beacuse I
          could not read my system w/o it on a 20Mhz AT clone)
 
 ------ 3.10.03 --------04/28/89--------------------------------------------
        * Bug Fixes:
          ZIP reader bug fixed
          Room info-line bug fixed
 
        * #DIRECTORY
          You can specify in external.cit directorys or groups of
          directorys that can NOT be made into directory rooms 
          when on remote. For example:
          #DIRECTORY  D:*
          Will allow no directorys to be made on D:.
 
        * Hidden Groups
          When renaming a group you can make it hidden. If you are remote 
          a hidden group can not be seen, or accessed in any way unless
          you are a member of that group. If on console you will see them
          in the .al and can rename them to undo it as needed.
 
        * Hallway descriptions
          Use .shr and it will ask you for it.
 
        * Screen Saved during shell/applications
 
 ------ 3.10.02 --------04/18/89--------------------------------------------
        * Twited and Moderated messages
          These will not go accrost the net if the node you are neting
          with is not a sysop.
          If the node is a sysop it will, with moderated/twited status
          perserved.
 
        * Bug fixes to Userlog Edit
 
        * ETC.EXE
          A small program to edit your ETC.DAT. Currently lets you
          change any of the modem-related options. Other items on its
          menu do not function. (notice, this program will be updated
          with each new version. You must use the ETC.EXE that comes
          with the version you are running.)
 
        * Ability to lock surnames on user by user basis
 
        * Revamped baud detect code
          Should solve some problems with verbose responses. 
          If someone calls while in console mode going to modem mode
          (F5) will log you out and let them on. (used to only work with
          Numeric, now works with the others as well.)
 
 ------ 3.10.01 --------04/14/89--------------------------------------------
        * Misc bug fixes.
        * Faster modem IO.
 
 ------ 3.10.00 --------04/01/89--------------------------------------------
        * #PRIVATE
          #private will now do the following:
          0 open system
          1 message to sysop
          2 message to sysop drop carrier
          3 enter user non-verified and ask name number surname(if configed)
          4 same as 3 with drop carrier
          5 newuserapp
          6 newuserapp drop carrier
          7 enter user non-verified and newuserapp
          8 same as 7 with drop carrier
          9 closed, tells them so in a blurb "closesys.blb"
          10 same as 9 with drop carrier.
 
        * CHAT REQUEST
          In the stat line you will now see the folowing in the chat box:
 
                      User requested chat             User did not
          Chat On     "RCht"                          "Chat"
          Chat Off    "rcht"                          "    "
 
        * .AIDE MOVEFILE
          Aide command to move a file from one directory room to another.
 
        * CVT.EXE and 30TO31.BAT
          CVT is a program that will upgrade the datafiles from one version 
          to the next. It is used with batchfiles wich feed it instructions.
 
          30TO31 is the batch file to convert from DragCit 3.0x.x to 
          DragCit 3.10.xx. 
 
          In any further releases the two middle digets will indicate either
          drastic changes or the need of a convert batchfile. (3.XX.??, the
          XX)
 
          Of course you will need to reconfig after the conversion, WICH YOU 
          SHOULD DO AFTER GETTING ANY NEW VERSION (hint, hint)
 
        * ACCOUNTING
          Due to screams and pleas for a simple and understanable accounting 
          system, one has been writen (by Joe of C' Hackers Forum). It is 
          based on the minute in the place of the Credit, and comes with 
          documentation. (ACCOUNT.DOC)
 
        * ANSI
          Your ANSI status is remebered from call to call.
 
        * AUTO-HALL
          This feature (toggable by user) will take you to the next hall 
          (just like hitting a '>') every time you get to a window room. 
          It is sort of like being in a sorted maintance hall. (or that is 
          the desired efect)
 
        * ROOM INFO-LINE
          If you now do a .Known [...] you will get the name of the room 
          plus a short (80 character) description. Sort of like an info-file.
 
          Example:
 
          Lobby>                 - First room in BBS
          Mail>                  - Leave E-Mail here
          Aide>>                 - Room for the AIDES, also a window
          ext....
 
        * FILE EXPANSION
          A number of the data files have been expanded to make room for
          features to come. Like hall descriptions and all sorts of odd
          things.
 
        * AIDEMESSAGE GROUPING
          All messages in the aide room from one event are now grouped into
          one message. (only one message of network errors, or for group
          globals, ext.)
 
        * THIS FILE
          This file will come with all new version produced by me 
          (The Dragon) and will be keep up-to-date as much as posible. 
          There are some things new in this version that have not been 
          mentioned, mostly beacuse I forgot what they were before I 
          started keeping this file.
