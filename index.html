<p>Remarks:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lincoln's Birthday '94 02:37:04 pst From Richard Goldfinder<br>
&nbsp;From 90Dec13 (perhaps 90Dec12; it was a long day) to 92Jul25 I worked on ACit,
making around 688 changes to the code that Matt gave me (he made DragCit 3.11 
compilable by Microsoft C).  First thing was to make it disable call-waiting 
when answering a call, which eventually evolved to the #DIAL_RING command.  
There were a bunch of other things that I wanted to do, and I did many (perhaps
most) of them.  There were some contributions, but I did maintained most of it,
until later.<br>
&nbsp;DragCit 3.12 was released, and Matt got interested.  He again made DragCit 
compilable by Microsoft C, and started fixing bugs and adding features.  There 
was a lot of development sharing between GremCit and ACit among the current 
"GremCit Team".  I was fairly conservative with my changes, Brent was fairly 
radical, and Matt took the middle road (still true today).<br>
&nbsp;My job took a lot of my spare hours away, and the time I devoted to ACit 
development dwindled.  Matt spent plenty of hours on GremCit development.  
GremCit was getting developed faster than ACit, and some BBSes were switching.
I finally gave up competing, and wrote a conversion program, telling the sysops
still using ACit that they should switch to GremCit for the best support.
